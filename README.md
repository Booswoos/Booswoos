### Hi there üëã

My name is Bartosz Janicki, but you can call me Bartek. Since high school, I have been interested in robotics and embedded systems. I began my journey by designing a line-following robot, then shifted my focus to mini-sumo and sumo bots, participating in several robotics competitions in Poland. During my engineering course, my colleagues and I won the Dean's award for the best group project of the year, for developing a robot inspired by SPOT by Boston Dynamics. In the meantime, I'm engaged in race car construciton for Formula Student competition. Until now, I have worked on several vehicles as a member of the electronics department and have appeared at numerous international competitions. In free time  I like to go hikining, bouldering or simply go out with friends.
